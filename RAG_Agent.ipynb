If you take a course in audit mode, you will be able to see most course materials for free. To access graded assignments and to earn a Certificate, you will need to purchase the Certificate experience, during or after your audit. If you don\\'t see the audit option: The course may not offer an audit option. You can try a Free Trial instead, or apply for Financial Aid.The course may offer \\'Full Course, No Certificate\\' instead. This option lets you see all course materials, submit required assessments, and get a final grade.
